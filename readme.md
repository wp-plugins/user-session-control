## Description ##

WordPress 4.1 "Dinah" introduced the awesome power of user session management.

However, you are limited to only being able to destroy your own sessions, and you cannot destroy them individually.

This plugin allows Administrators to view and manage all sessions by all users on an individual basis.

* Displays a custom "God view" screen of all active user sessions
* Sort sessions by user, role, creation date, expiry date or IP address
* Quickly and easily destroy sessions you think may be a security risk

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/fjarrett/user-session-control). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues reported](https://github.com/fjarrett/user-session-control/issues) there before going to the plugin forum.**
