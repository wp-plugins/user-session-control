View and manage all active user sessions in a custom admin screen.

== Description ==

The WordPress 4.1 "Dinah" release introduced the awesome power of user session management. However, you are only able to destroy your own sessions in from your own profile screen.

This plugin allows Administrators to view and manage all sessions by all users.

* Displays a custom "God-view" screen of all active user sessions
* You can sort sessions by user, role, creation date, expiry date or IP address
* Easily destroy sessions you think are a security risk

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/fjarrett/user-session-control). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues reported](https://github.com/fjarrett/user-session-control/issues) there before going to the plugin forum.**

== Screenshots ==

1. The familiar list table view allows you to view and manage all active user sessions easily.
2. All columns are sortable in ascending and descending order so you can quickly find the sessions you are looking for.
